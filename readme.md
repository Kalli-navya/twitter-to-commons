Odia WIkipedia Community collaborated with government of Odisha and brought many of the govt's social accounts under CC-BY-4.0 license. This helps the Odia Community to upload images from those govt twitter handles to Wikimedia Commons directly and easily rather than downloading and uploading images from Twitter to Wikimedia Commons. This will will be useful for anyone who makes their twitter handle under CC license and has an OTRS token.
